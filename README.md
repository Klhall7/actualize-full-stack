## Purpose
This project is for a task management and learning assistant targeted towards individuals who need a one-stop place for personal development. They can create and manage tasks in order to achieve any goal and get an overview of their progress to stay motivated and organized. While this version of the app is geared towards individual growth it can be adapted to a professional target audience as well. The design would be altered to focus on a companyâ€™s onboarding process to include skill development, training, and task management.
